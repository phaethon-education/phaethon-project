# Project Phaethon: Whitepaper on the New Human Education System for Mars 0.1


1. Vision and Background
As humanity faces the triple challenges of environmental limits, resource depletion, and the technological singularity, expanding to outer planets has become the only forward-looking strategic option for the continuation of human civilization. Mars, as the celestial body with the greatest potential for settlement, offers a historic opportunity for civilizational reconstruction.
However, rockets and bases alone cannot sustain a society. Settlers on Mars will face a critical reality: the education system must be built from scratch and capable of rapidly enabling knowledge transfer, skill regeneration, social organization, and life system reconstruction in extreme environments.
Project Phaethon was born with the vision to:
Develop a modular education system for Mars settlers, centered on a cognitive operating system, integrating AGI teaching agents, survival construction pathways, ecological restoration, and social experimentation to support the growth of a new civilization.
2. Design Principles
Modularity: All educational content is organized into modules for easy recombination, localized deployment, and parallel iteration.
DAO-ready: Each module is a task unit, governable and co-evolved by distributed communities.
Extreme Resource Adaptability: Designed for scarcity of time, energy, and computing power, the system must be highly compressed and locally autonomous.
Cognitive Operating System: Education goes beyond knowledge transfer to rebuild a complete set of "cognitive approaches" and "problem-solving methodologies."
Task-Driven: Learning is building, cognition is action, with knowledge organized around practical engineering needs.
