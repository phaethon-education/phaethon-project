# Project Phaethon: Cognitive Education System for Martian Settlers

> Rebuilding education is not optional—it is the operating system of civilization on Mars.

Project Phaethon is a modular, DAO-ready cognitive education framework designed for humans living on Mars. It integrates AGI-assisted learning, task-driven engineering, ecological reconstruction, and micro-governance experiments to support the rise of a sustainable, interplanetary civilization.
